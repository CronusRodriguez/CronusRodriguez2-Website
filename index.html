        <p class="lead mb-4">Hi, my name is Cronus Rodriguez and Iâ€™m attending the University of California, Riverside otherwise known as UCR. Iâ€™m from San Bernardino, California and I have lived there for most of life. I considered myself to be a normal kid because I was always in sports and doing well in school. I started noticing that throughout my childhood and in my teenage years maybe I wasnâ€™t so interested in school as much as I was in sports. I started giving sports a lot of my time and that helped me get out of my shell. It helped me make friends, helped me get disciplined and it really just helped with overall my personal development. Sports have and will always play a big role in who I am as a person.	My parents would support me no matter what, whether it be soccer or school and that helped me a lot and as a thank you I chose to do both pretty well. In San Bernardino neither was easy though as there was a lot of gang violence growing up and it was hard to learn with everything going on. Sports were okay but not the best because no one would make a high enough GPA to play. I didnâ€™t let any of that stop me though as I graduated 47 out of 574 in my class and being recognized as one of the top athletes in the school.  <br><br>

         I am majoring in Pre-Business here at the University and that is because business was just something that always interested me. As a young child my father always instilled in me how significant it was to own a business and simply being in the business world could take you far in life. I think that majoring in business will help me grow as a person and help me get out of my comfort zone because now I will have to be able to talk comfortably with people who I donâ€™t know but I will have to make it work because business isnâ€™t about being comfortable with your environment itâ€™s about making due with what is there. <br><br>

        Iâ€™d say the reason I am where I am today would have to be because of my parents. It was all them pushing me to my best and making sure I had what I needed. We werenâ€™t a rich family but we had what we needed and they made sure we always had food on our plates, never showing that they were worried about making next month's paycheck. I saw that my father was a very hard working man and till this day he is my biggest inspiration. He is the type of person to never give up and he brought that onto his kids and my mom was always at the house making sure her kids would be successful and for that I thank them both. Thanks to my parents I am studying at one of the best schools in California. I just wanted to let everyone who is reading this know that if I can do it, so can you.
